                 I wasn't one of those people who was given a camera at age five and fell in love with photography.
                 I was a travel journalist, working my dream job with Lonely Planet at age 23 when the magic of 
                 Marrakech begged me to take its photo.
                 Since that trip in 2007 I became hooked on photographing patterns hidden within landscapes, extreme 
                 climates, cultures and the underwater world. My business The Wandering Lens, works with global brands 
                 producing visual content and image libraries/editorials for various publications, tourism/commercial 
                 clients and also operates as a travel photography site, which is now the leading publisher of travel 
                 guides for photographers.
                 In 2009 I opened a landscape gallery on Hayman Island with the glimmering Great Barrier Reef at my 
                 doorstep for six years. 
                 This location led to my obsession of documenting the environment above and below the surface. It the 
                 details of nature that inspire my photography. Patterns carved by climates, movement in water and 
                 colourful skies, I believe photography is as much about seeing as it is capturing.
                 My recent project, The Photographic Forecast, focuses on regions of environmental significance. Images 
                 from Greenland to Namibia, Chile and Australia feature in a print collection from which proceeds are 
                 donated to conservation initiatives.
